# MineSweeperJava
A basic rendition of Mine Sweeper written in Java (wrote this a long time ago)

This program uses files provided by a professor for elemen ts of the GUI and event listeners for running the Gui.

To run minesweeper you run the MineSweeper file. (so, for instance, on a mac you would from the terminal type "java MineSweeper", from inside the directory of this repository).
